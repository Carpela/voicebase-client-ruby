        # this was added because with the V1 API, a value in the returned JSON indicates both a
        # successful HTTP request, but also a ready transcript. With V2, there's no JSON value
        # to indicate status. Instead, the HTTP status code indicates request status, and
        # the state becoming "finished" indicates the transcript it ready.
